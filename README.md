# Effective-Antibiotic-Treatment
This repository contains an Insight Maker model (The links are attached below) that focuses on optimizing antibiotic treatment for patients. The model simulates various treatment strategies and provides insights into the most effective and efficient ways to administer antibiotics while minimizing The intensity of treatment.

## Features
- Simulates and models different treatment scenarios and compare between and compares infusion treatment with pill treatment.
- Find and prove the optimal treatment While referring to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
- Analyzes the impact of dosage, timing, and duration of antibiotics.
- Provides recommendations.

## Usage
1. Open the Insight Maker model (insert link or instructions here).
2. Configure the parameters based on your patient's condition.
3. Run the simulation to receive treatment recommendations.
